# Translator
Discord Bot

Probably the most cleanest translation bot on Discord

---

Key Features :-

- Do not spam in active chat channels, Gives translation in specific channel which should have name `translation-log`.
- Do not have to type anything just react with the emoji on message you want to translate and you will get the translation. As of now bot gives support for only two languages Chinese and English but languages can be added easily.
- Free for small servers. I don't have any way to accept payment overseas so I cannot let it translate for bigger servers where cost of running api and hosting bot will make me broke
